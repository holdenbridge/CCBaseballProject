# CCBaseballProject

In this personal project, I worked with recent Centennial Conference baseball data to analyze which teams were most effective using a number of sabermetric statistics not currently used in Division III baseball. Meant to be a resource for the Swarthmore College baseball coaching staff to help with recruiting and offensive strategy and an introduction to sabermetrics for myself.
